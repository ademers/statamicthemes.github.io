  I have decided to move Statamic Themes on to GitHub Pages
  and I thought it deserved a post to explain why and how
  I would like to see it working.

The purpose of the site is to help the community with useful posts and list as many themes and plugins that i can come across. For a while now I have wanted to do more with the site and just haven't been able to make the time to write more posts.

### Why Move to GitHub Pages
I have played around with Jekyll before and it's quite a simple language to get going with and of course your content is written in markdown with YAML so converting the site from Statamic was pretty straightforward.
