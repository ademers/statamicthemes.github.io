  In this quick tutorial I take you
  through how to compare the different
  versions of Statamic so that you can
  upgrade seamlessly. Using a Mac app tool
  called Kaleidoscope you can quickly and
  easily compare folders and files to
  ensure that you have updated everything
  required for the latest version of
  Statamic to work.

Once Statamic moves out of recoil (v1.6) there should be only two folders that you need to update _app and admin, but it doesn't do any harm to quickly compare versions before upgrading to ensure that you have made all the changes required to keep your Statamic sites working seamlessly. [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com) is a wonderful tool which to be quite honest I couldn't work without and I use it on a daily basis for comparing files and folders and resolving git conflicts, so I recommend giving it a try.
