  This is part one of a series on how to build a website using the    [Statarkers](http://www.statamicthemes.com/themes/statarkers-theme)
  theme for Statamic. The Statarkers theme is a boilerplate which
  enables you to quickly begin creating Statamic themes and is
  loosely based on the Starkers theme created by Elliot Jay Stocks for Wordpress.
